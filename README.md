# Blazor5Email
A Blazor Wasm App with the following:
- Email sending
- Razor Templates for email

The goal of this is to learn email techniques.  I recognize this is all server side and really has nothing to do with Blazor, I just wanted to put it together in the context of a blazor app for practice purposes.
